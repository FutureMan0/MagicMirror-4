## 🏗️ Plug & Play Module System

MM⁴ uses a **Dynamic Module Loader**. Adding features is as easy as dropping a folder into the `modules/` directory:

*   **Auto-Scan:** MM⁴ detects new folders in the `modules/` directory automatically.
*   **Instant UI:** New modules appear immediately in the Web UI's "Store" for activation.
*   **Clean Structure:** Each module is self-contained with its own logic, styles, and settings.
